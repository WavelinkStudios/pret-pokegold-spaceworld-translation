# Pokémon Gold and Silver: Space World 1997 Demo [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a work-in-progress disassembly of the Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver prototypes demoed at Space World 1997.

It builds the following ROMs:

- Gold_debug.sgb `sha1: b1d7539a87dea81b2cff6146afaad64470d08d84`
- Gold_debug.sgb (correct header) `sha1: 87fd8dbe5db39619529abcfc99e74cc5ecb8b94e`

You will need to provide a copy of Gold_debug.sgb renamed **baserom.gb** to build the ROMs.
